Motivation :
------------

In Density Functional Theory calculations, one is often required to manipulate lattice vectors for a supercell.  
For example, to calculate elastic constants we have to strain/stretch the lattice vectors to differnt extents. 

The OCTAVE scripts provided here allows you do the very same thing.

OCTAVE is an open source linear algebra based computing platforms, which effectively mimics commercially available MATLAB package. 


Limitations of the Code:
------------------------
The code is written for OCTAVE using VI editor, and is tested on OSX (Mountain Lion & Yosemite) ONLY. Potential users are reccomended
to test this module on their respective platforms. Furthermore, I cannot guarantee that this code could be used "AS IS" 
and the user may be required "tweak" it to suite their needs.
